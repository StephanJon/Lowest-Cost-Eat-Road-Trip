# Lowest-Cost-Eat-Road-Trip
Used Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm ad implemented BFS and DFS to calculate the lowest cost road 
trip from Boston to Minneapolis based off of what was eaten during the road trip.

Used a .csv of major US Cities, example restaurants in each city, and menu items and their prices
of each restaurant chain.
